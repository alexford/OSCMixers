# OSCMixers

Swift module for interacting with mixing consoles via OSC.

This is basically a domain-specific abstraction on top of [orchetect/OSCKit](https://github.com/orchetect/OSCKit).

It is extremely experimental. I don't know what I'm doing.

## Features

* Establish connection and get basic mixer info
* _More planned_

## Mixer Support

* Behringer XR18
* _More planned_
